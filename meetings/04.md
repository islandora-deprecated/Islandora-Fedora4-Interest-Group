## Notes

1. Introductions

2. Updates
  * Code4Lib - oppourtunity for face to face work. Tremendous progress:
    * [Fedora Community Data Model](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/FF/Fedora+Community+Data+Model)<--emerging shared data model in Fedora. Andrew Woods gathered Code4Lib attendees for a working lunch. Nick documented main data models for Islandora. Good news is that there is a good overlap with the Hydra work. This document now refers to a shared Fedora data model to be used by Hydra and Islandora. Most like the Compound data model says Nick, but simple objects can still be built, says David. Merge the whole paged content and compound concepts into one with different ways of ordering "children" and the use of "proxy" for recording multiple orderings. Three different types of objects (containers) one is a generic collection, a generic "container," and a generic "file." "Container" nomenclature is still up in the air. Read the document for additional details, and the conversation remains quite active, so all are invited to wiki page or Andrew Woods thread. The emerging model would cover Islandora use cases. 
    * [Islandora and Fedora 4 proof of concept](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6Yw5c4XZp4) <-- Danny got together the proof of concept and gave brief presenatation. See Youtube video. Drupal/Fedora 4 and middleware running. If you go and start making objects or "containers" in Fedora it will start creating Drupal nodes and put Fedora RDF as the node article text. Just a proof of concept to show that we can listen to Fedora's messages and consume them/do meaningful things in Drupal. Hinges on Drupal services module. JSON message constructed from Fedora message and posted to Drupal. Lots left to do for security, and indexing to Solr and Triplestore. Chef was a problem at Code4lib, so a bunch of bash scripts were written and tied together with Vagrant. See http://islandora-labs.github.io/islandora/install/README/. Can install demo in about 10 minutes from this repo. If people want to develop they can come develop, can show to bosses, etc. The idea is that everybody can use bash scripts in whatever approach they choose, so not tied to chef, ansible, or anything else. If you want to contribute to this project, you do not have to follow LSAP at this stage. All contributions welcome! Getting to the point where steps can be outlined and distributed to those helping with the project. Bash scripts likely to be broken down a little further. Eventually it would be great to make modular enough so that we one can set up distributed installation a lot more easily. 
  * [Technical design](http://islandora-labs.github.io/islandora/technical-documentation/technical_design/)
    * Danny put together this document. Danny has updated document since last meeting. Additional topics have been added. "The Plan" has been fleshed out as well as the use of Camel (Apache Camel component). Scripting language part is likely to evolve for more freedom of choice. A lot more to do on the Drupal end of things. Lots of other modules implicated, including Drupal relationships. More documentation will be written about the use of services. Piece of middleware doing two things - (consuming Fedoraqueue messages and doing things with them).[See this gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/Islandora-Labs/islandora/images/layer-interaction.gif) <--  should be much more robust use of Drupal's native features and functions. For each complex action (performing a sequence of operations) the middleware will expose a new service. There will be issues with messaging (ordering and timing) but hopefully this will give us much better performance, and won't be 'bothering' Fedora as much. Lots more traffic for Drupal. Review next week for a lot more documentation. There is a question about scalability in Drupal, but much will depend upon how Drupal is tuned (postgres tuning and caching). There will be a lot of sysadmin work involved. But you can scale and cluster Drupal, just like you can scale and cluster Fedora. It will be a challenge, but is very doable. Solr approach is still up for grabs, but project is very open to leveraging existing Drupal solutions, such as Apache Solr if it works. The proposed solution for replacing XML forms will play heavily into what approach is followed. What do we do with our descriptive and technical metadata streams? XML standard will be persisted in the repository. Review XML field in Drupal and xpath module. Discussion of MODSRDF (including issue of blank nodes). Think carefully, warns Aaron, before jumping into MODS RDF, especially when you need to continue to produce XML.  More strict RDF route can be mapped to field in Drupal. Need a good solution for everybody, not just push people toward RDF.
  * [Documentation](http://islandora-labs.github.io/islandora/)
    * One of the goals has been to keep things in a single repository. Everything lives [here](https://github.com/islandora-labs/islandora). There is a folder called documentation, and Nick is using a Python program (mkdocs) wich has yaml file to outline documentation structure. Two commands will generate Git Pages based on up to date documentation. [See also](http://islandora-labs.github.io/islandora/technical-documentation/docs-build/). Information for how to contribute to the project is [provided on Github as well](http://islandora-labs.github.io/islandora/contributing/contributing/). Please contribute and comment on this documentation. 
  * [Audit Service](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/FF/2015-02-20+-+Audit+Service+Planning+Meeting) 
     * Met on the audit services at Code4lib and had a call last week for use cases and proposals for the Audit service. There are lots of todos to ouline the differences between approaches. [Meeting notes from the Audit Services Meeting](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/FF/2015-02-20+-+Audit+Service+Planning+Meeting) These meetings are outlining use cases will inform functional requirements and tickets that will be taken care of at the end of March. David notes that there are two code sprints beginning end March. They need a total of 3 developers on each sprint, and have 2 developers currently for each one. Four action items have been assigned. Once the actions are finished and unanswered questions are answered, functional requirements can be finalized. Meeting happening last week. Here is the [Doodle poll](http://doodle.com/52b5dwtxmztehadf). Here is also the [plan being developed for Audit service](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/FF/Design+-+Audit+Service)
     * [Migration Approaches are being designed](https://github.com/fcrepo4-labs/migration-utils). Mike and Danny working together on a migration approach. 
     * [Here are the Github issues for the project around this so far](https://github.com/Islandora-Labs/islandora/labels/upgration)
     * Camel in combination with FOXML crawl. Mike has dealt with a lot of the challenges for Fedora 3 and now it is poised to become a service in the stack. A fair bit is in solid enough footing that we can continue - some things will change in the community content model and will require some refactoring, but we can get most of the way there with this start. 
     * Danny is open to helping others who are getting up to speed with some components. Beginning next week! Lots of progress. 
     * Migration likely happen to happen in phases, recursively 1. create collections; 2. create simple objects; 3. develop compounds. PIDs will likely be mapped in a table so that it can be recorded for new object. Datastream label still be developed. Mapping also needs to exist between path in Fedora 4 and NID. 
    * [Template](https://github.com/Islandora/Islandora-Fedora4-Interest-Group/wiki/Use-Case-template)
     * Please add use cases based on this template
     * Islandora folk encouraged to get engaged with Fedora 4 community's discussion, but no perceived blockers or red flags in the Fedora development. It would be especially good to hear from more librarians in the Islandora community. 
    * [Use cases](https://github.com/Islandora/Islandora-Fedora4-Interest-Group/labels/use%20case)

Next Meeting March 27th at 1:00 EST. Nick will put out call for attendees the week before, but let him know as soon as possible in case we need to revise meeting method (get booted from Skype)
